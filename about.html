            <h3>Values & Principles</h3>
            <p>Providenzia Capital Group (Suisse) S.A. is neither a bank, nor just a family office. Instead, we
                bring
                together the best of both worlds&#8239;: the high service standards and transparency expected of a
                private
                family
                office, combined with the quality of investment expertise and operational excellence typically
                associated
                with a major global financial institution. To deliver this we have built our reputation upon four
                pillars&#8239;:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="columns">
            <div><h4>Objectivity & Independence</h4>
                <p>We are not tied to in-house managed funds or products. Our team is free to focus on the most
                    appropriate
                    investment solution for an individual portfolio without conflict of interest. We implement
                    customized
                    portfolios with the objective of selecting the best. We charge a single investment management fee
                    and we
                    never keep commissions on third party products.</p>
            </div>
            <div><h4>Alignment of Interest</h4>
                <p>The assets of Providenzia Capital Group’s partners and the clients are managed side by side. All
                    clients
                    can
                    expect the same high levels of service, and are on the same fee scale. Access to the same managers
                    is
                    also
                    assured across our clients with capacity being shared pro-rata between them.</p>
            </div>
            <div><h4>Intelligence</h4>
                <p>Our investment team is led by professionals with extensive experience managing equity, bond and hedge
                    fund
                    portfolios directly, in some of the world’s most highly regarded fund management firms.</p>
            </div>
            <div><h4>Flexibility</h4>
                <p>We are flexible and tailor each service to meet the particular needs of each client.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="center">
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>Our approach goes far beyond conventional asset management. We aim to add value across the whole
                spectrum
                of
                a client’s family wealth, from long-term strategic planning and investments to day-to-day advice and
                administration.</p>
            <ul class="underligned">In order to ensure holistic wealth planning and management, our approach is based on a three pillars
                concept&#8239;:
                <li>Protecting the family fortune through the use of suitable legal structures and the tax-optimized
                    transfer of assets to the next generation
                </li>
                <li>Growing wealth by defining and executing an investment process that reflects the client’s
                    objectives
                </li>
                <li>Controlling the investment process using management, monitoring and reporting systems.</li>
